					<h1>Our care workers</h1>                    <p>We recognise that a care worker&nbsp;is someone that service users will spend a lot of time with;&nbsp;not just in a professional capacity, but as a companion. Our recruitment process is therefore designed to employ carers who are not just the best professionally, but are people with whom our service users will feel happy and comfortable.</p>

<p>There is no denying that working in care is a challenge &ndash; but speak to any care worker, and they&rsquo;ll tell you just how satisfying and personally rewarding their career is to them. We employ care workers from all walks of life and with a range of experiences, from those fresh out of university to older carers who are looking for a new challenge. Many hold professional qualifications, such as CQF Level 2 or 3.</p>

<p>Our recruitment process is strict, with criminal background checks, and UK Border&nbsp;checks for immigration status. New carers must take part in two weeks of extensive training before working with our service users. They&nbsp;receive detailed training on an ongoing basis throughout their time with Focus Care Link &ndash; as well as being encouraged to undertake their own personal development programmes.</p>

<p>Our care workers must demonstrate integrity, reliability, empathy, patience, gentleness and compassion, along with respect for privacy and confidentiality, helpfulness, understanding, support, and a hardworking and caring mentality.</p>
