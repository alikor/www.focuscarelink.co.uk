					<h1>About Us</h1>                    <p>Focus Care Link is a leading specialist in Domiciliary Care in and around London, offering a range of care packages to those who are in need of care and support in their own homes.</p>

<p>We understand that there is no better place to be than in your own home, particularly when times are tough. We work with young people, adults and the elderly to offer tailored care packages to suit individual needs, allowing those we work with to live happily and safely in their own home for as long as possible. Independence, support and avoiding disruption are important to all of us: why should that change when care is needed?</p>

<p>Focus Care Link was established in 2004 from a desire to help the vulnerable by providing the highest quality home care services. Finding that no other company was addressing the needs of the vulnerable adequately, Focus Care Link quickly grew from a one man band to a well-known company covering a larger area.</p>

<p>It is quality and passion that have helped Focus Care Link to grow, and, along with a huge amount of investment in our staff and our services, sets us apart from other care providers. Each of the three branches &ndash; Camden, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest &ndash; are looked after by a qualified, registered manager, with over 40 years of care experience spanning the three sites.</p>

<p>Focus Care Link is a registered company, regulated by the Care Quality Commission. &nbsp;We are members of the Home Care Association, and comply with the General Social Care Council&rsquo;s Code of Conduct.</p>               	</article>
